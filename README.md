# Getting to know rust
#### MATERIALS
[Official rust online book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
#### RUN WITH CARGO
Each of the folders contains a rust application which can be ran with
```bash
$ cargo run
```

Except for <i>programming_concepts</i> which have not been built using cargo.
The files are heavily commented so I would recommend reading them through.
```bash
$ ./programming_concepts/{file_name}
```
