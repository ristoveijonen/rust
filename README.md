# Getting to know rust
#### MATERIALS
[Official rust online book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

### DESCRIPTION
Each of the folders represent a chapter from the rust programming language book. The book is free and linked above.
Beginning of the book is more comments than code, but the ratio balances out as the examples grow more advanced.

#### RUN WITH CARGO
Each of the folders contains a rust application which can be ran with
```bash
$ cargo run
```

Except for <i>programming_concepts</i> which have not been built using cargo.
```bash
$ ./programming_concepts/{file_name}
```
